# Azure OnlineExperimentation Samples client library for Java

This directory contains samples for the Azure Analytics Online Experimentation client library for Java.

## Key concepts

The samples demonstrate:

- Client initialization
- Creating different types of experiment metrics
- Validating experiment metric definitions
- Retrieving and listing metrics
- Updating metrics
- Deleting metrics

## Getting started

Getting started information can be found in the [library README][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].
